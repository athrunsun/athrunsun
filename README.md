### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the home of a passionate but quiet GEEK.

#### Tech stack
- React, JSX rocks.
- Vue, less mental burden.
- Go, simpler and more efficient multi-threading.
- Cloud native, compose my containers like a pro.
- LLM/agent, entering the new era.

#### Interests
- Docker/podman. Perhaps someday we can compose an OS by containers.
- 3D/WebGL. Webpages will be 3D in the future.
- Astronomy. Can you imagine the diameter of a massive black hole like [TON 618](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TON_618) is 33 times the diameter of our Solar system?
- Science fiction. Have you watched Interstellar? It's a great movie.
- Crazy fan of voice actor/actress (or character voice, or CV for short, or å£°ä¼˜ in Chinese).

#### Other facts about me
- Blue is my favorite color. It is the color of the ocean, which looks cold in its apprearance but has a strong power inside.
- I love cats more than dogs.
- I prefer 2 spaces as a tab.

#### CI status
- personal-scoop-bucket: [![regular_build](https://github.com/athrunsun/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/regular-build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/athrunsun/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/regular-build.yaml)
